1. Design folder is the ideas and experimental configuration prior to the physical run of the experiments
2. Simulation data preparation folder is for preparing data to run active learning simulation 
3. 1st_round folder is for initialization (training) data and validation data
4. 2ns_round folderis only for training data
5. Accuracy folder is for the validation of the trained model
